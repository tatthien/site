Hi, I'm Daniel. Welcome to my little digital garden!

I'm a full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience developing web platforms from idea to delivery.

Right now, I'm working at [Fanzeal](https://fanzeal.com) as a Senior Software Engineer.

Besides working, I love writing because I think sharing is also learning, everyone is deserved to learn from your knowledge and experience.
