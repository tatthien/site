I'm a full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience developing web platforms in Vue.js, Node.js, Golang, and other frameworks, from idea to delivery.

I also work as a devops engineer helping other developers to set up dev/stag/prod environments with fully automated CI/CD using GitLab CI/CD, Docker, K8S, Lightsail, and AWS services.

I can adapt quickly to new working environments or new cutting-edge technologies.

For leadership skills, I've worked as a team leader for a small team of 5 members. Helped everyone in the team to distribute tasks, deliver/explain managers' ideas, and requirements.

Besides working, I love writing because I think sharing is also learning, everyone is deserved to learn from your knowledge and experience.
